1. Writing a feature based SLAM not a dense SLAM.

- Cicles not well distributed across the image. Lot better to break the image up in to
a grid.

- Separate detect and compute. We can do compute later.

- Clusters are a problem. ORB has a border which it can't create.

- Maybe use a fundamental matrix for filtering.

- Maybe add cross check back in.

- RANSAC is used to negate the massive effect of outliers. Sensor data will always be
  imperfect.
